I am currently pursuing Ph.D. in application of Reinforcement Learning under the supervision of [Dr. Arghyadip Roy](https://sites.google.com/view/arghyadiproy/home) in [MFSDSAI](https://www.iitg.ac.in/dsai/), [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/). I have completed M.Sc. in Mathematics and Computing from IIT Guwahati. Previously I was with [DeltaV Robotics](https://deltavrobo.com/) working in ML and Mathematical Modelling. I love doing mathematics, sketching and photography. I am deeply interested in the intersection of AI and healthcare and aspire to make meaningful contributions in the future.
